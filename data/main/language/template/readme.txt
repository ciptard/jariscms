Translation Files
-----------------

Jaris CMS uses gettext to translate all PHP page displayable content
strings.
The translation directory 'languages' includes, other than the 'template'
one, all languages categorized in each own directory.
The template one, where this file belongs, includes all templates needed
to create new languages:

- info.php      describes the new language with displayed and id name
- jariscms.pot  JarisCMS translation strings template
- install.pot   JarisCMS installation translation strings template

You can use the built in translation editor in JarisCMS to translate all
strings or some external editor (E.g. PoEdit).
