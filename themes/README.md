##Introduction

Jaris works with a PHP based theming system that brings all the powerful features of the language to theme integrators.

Learning another theme system can be tedious, so if you are already doing PHP coding you should feel right at home. While there are many people that prefer a third party theme engine I opted for a PHP solution to keep requirements to a minimum.

##How it Works?

Each theme consist of a basic set of base files that constitute the skeleton needed for a working theme. These files are:

 * block.php - A block is a special way of adding snippets of content to the page. You can place them on the header, center, left, right and footer of the page. This template file is used for global blocks and is displayed within page.php.
 
 * block-content.php - Content blocks share the same use of global blocks but at the content level. They can only be assigned to a single page and are displayed within the content.php template. 

 * content.php - Html for the part of the site that displays the main content, this template also makes use of content blocks and is displayed within page.php.

 * info.php - Store the information of the theme like main author, contact details as theme name and version.

 * page.php - The main skeleton of each displayed page. This is the final theme file used to combine all other theme files.

 * preview.png - A preview image of the theme with a size of 200px x 150px
 
 * search-header.php - Heading of search results (optional)
 
 * search-result.php - Results row (optional)
 
 * search-footer.php - Footer of search results (optional)

 * style.css - The main style of the theme automatically appended to the head section of the page.

 * user-profile.php - If user profiles are enabled on the cms settings then this template is used for that purpose.
 
###Mixing it all together

The following ascii graphic shows how template files are used and where on the page they are displayed. It starts from page.php been the main container that includes every other theme file.

The above graphic is just a general concept so that you can quickly understand how the theme files are used, but it doesn't means you would need to always use this kind of format. From page.php you can control where the content and global blocks are displayed, while from content.php file you can control where the content blocks are displayed.

##Granularity

As you can notice the page.php file serves as the main skeleton for all pages. What happens if you want to add a custom skeleton for a specific section of your site? Lets say you have a section named 'About' and the uri to access this section is 'about' (mydomain.com/about), you would need to create another page.php file renamed to page-about.php to give a custom look to this page.

You can add more theme files to theme specific parts of the site. To do this you copy one of the base theme files and rename it to match one individual element of your choice. Obviously there are certain rules and conventions for the extra theme files name used.

###Pages

For pages you have 2 ways of theming specific sections. The first one is specifying the uri after the word 'page' followed by a dash ( - ) as mentioned before. For example:

	page-uri.php
	
The other method is to give the same look to all the pages that belong to a top level section by appending a dash at the end, that functions as a '*' wildcard. For example, you have the section "docs", and you want to style each sub-section of it like "docs/introduction" the same, you would create a template file named as follows:

	page-docs-.php
	
###Content

For theming the region of the site that displays the main text/content you have also two options. As pages you can name your templates as follows:

	content-uri.php
	
The other way of theming your content is by indicating the machine name of the content type, first lets discuss some details. Jaris supports the addition of different types of content type. By default jaris ships with the 'page' content type. As an example lets assume you created a new content type named 'Products' with the machine name 'product'. This new content type has custom fields that you want to display to the public, also you may want to display images on a carrousel with some nice effects. To accomplish the mentioned actions you will need to create a custom content template for the content type 'product' as follows:

	content-product.php

###Blocks

Blocks can be themed by position. The valid positions for a block are: 

 * header
 * center
 * left
 * right
 * footer
 
Blocks can be also themed by the id of a block which is the numerical value assigned to it by the system, and page or uri where the block is being displayed. The following is a reference to the name file formats supported.

 * block-position-id.php
 * block-position.php
 * block-uri.php
 
###Content Blocks
 
As mentioned before, content blocks work the same way as blocks due but belong only to a single page and are displayed inside the content.php template. They support same name formats supported by blocks plus some additional ones:
 
 * block-content-position-id.php
 * block-content-position.php
 * block-content-uri-position.php
 * block-content-uri.php
 * block-content-type.php

Like you can see it supports two new name formats "block-content-uri-position" and "block-content-type". The first one should be obvious, and the second one uses the type of content been displayed.

###User Profiles

With the user profile template you can control how profile pages look by username or group as follows:

 * user-profile-username-the_username.php
 * user-profile-group.php

##Variables

Each of the template files discussed so far have access to a set of predefined variables. I will list them here for convenience. Beside the predefined variables you can call core Jaris functions from theme files for more control and custom functionality over the templates.

###page.php

 * $title - A combination of $site_title and $content_title.
 * $header_info - System generated metatags.

## Theme info file

The theme info.php file purpose is to provide you with a facility to include the theme author and some other details. It consist of an associative array named $theme with the following indexes:

 * name - Name of the theme.
 * description - Description of the theme.
 * version - Numerical version of the theme.
 * author - Main author name.
 * email - Main author e-mail.
 * website  - Main author site.
 
Here is some example of the info.php content:

	<?php
		$theme["name"] = "My Theme";
		$theme["description"] = "A theme created by me.";
		$theme["version"] = "1.0";
		$theme["author"] = "My Name";
		$theme["email"] = "myemail@mypersonalorcorporatesite.com";
		$theme["website"] = "http://mypersonalorcorporatesite.com";
	?>
